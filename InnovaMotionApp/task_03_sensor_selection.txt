Task: Add Sensor Selection to Aggregator Dashboard
Priority: Medium
Files to Create/Modify:
- Modify: app/src/main/java/com/melisa/innovamotionapp/ui/fragments/LivePostureFragment.java
- Modify: app/src/main/java/com/melisa/innovamotionapp/ui/adapters/AggregatorDashboardPagerAdapter.java

Description:
1. In `LivePostureFragment` (Tab 2 of Aggregator Dashboard):
   - Add a "Sensor Selector" (Spinner/Dropdown) at the top.
   - Populate it with all known sensor IDs (from `PersonNamesViewModel` or `PersonNameManager`).
2. When a sensor is selected:
   - Update the visualization to show ONLY that sensor's live data.
   - Show the 4 navigation buttons below the visualization:
     - "Monitorizare" (Go to BtConnectedActivity for this sensor)
     - "Statistica" (Go to StatisticsActivity for this sensor)
     - "Activitati" (Go to ActivitiesActivity - if exists)
     - "Consum energetic" (Go to EnergyConsumptionActivity for this sensor)
3. Ensure the selected sensor ID is passed to these activities via Intent Extras.

Technical Details:
- Observe `PersonNameManager` or `ReceivedBtDataDao` for list of sensors.
- Use `LiveData` to filter the displayed posture based on selection.
