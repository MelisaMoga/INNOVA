Task: Update Child Activities to Filter by Sensor ID
Priority: High
Files to Create/Modify:
- Modify: app/src/main/java/com/melisa/innovamotionapp/activities/StatisticsActivity.java
- Modify: app/src/main/java/com/melisa/innovamotionapp/activities/EnergyConsumptionActivity.java
- Modify: app/src/main/java/com/melisa/innovamotionapp/activities/TimeLapseActivity.java (if used for "Activitati")
- Modify: Data Access Objects (DAOs) and ViewModels for these activities.

Description:
1. These activities currently likely query *all* data or global data.
2. Update `onCreate` to read `EXTRA_SENSOR_ID` from Intent.
3. If `sensorId` is present, filter the database queries to show ONLY data for that `sensorId`.
4. If `sensorId` is missing (legacy/fallback), deciding on behavior (show all? or show error?). Preferably show all or current user's own data (if applicable).
5. Update the UI to show which person's data is being displayed (e.g., "Statistics for: Ion Popescu").

Technical Details:
- Update Room DAOs to add `WHERE sensor_id = :sensorId` to queries.
- Update ViewModels to accept `sensorId` as a filter parameter.
