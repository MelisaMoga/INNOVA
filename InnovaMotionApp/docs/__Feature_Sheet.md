## Core Features

### 1. Real-Time Fall Detection & Alerts
- Automatic detection when supervised user falls
- Instant push notifications to supervisor's device
- Notification includes supervised user's identity (name/email)
- 24-hour alert window ensures falls aren't missed even during offline periods
- Smart fall detection via posture analysis from wearable device
- Multiple notification channels (in-app alerts + system notifications)

### 2. Continuous Posture Monitoring
- Constant tracking of posture data from wearable Bluetooth device
- Live updates every 500 milliseconds
- Visual dashboard showing current posture status
- Real-time posture classification (standing, sitting, lying, falling)
- Instant visual feedback with animated posture representations
- Historical trend analysis capability through local database

### 3. Dual Role System
- **Supervised User**: Wear the device and generate posture data
  - Connect personal Bluetooth wearable device
  - Data automatically collected and uploaded to cloud
  - Local notifications for fall events
  - Full control over device connection settings
- **Supervisors**: Monitor one supervised user remotely
  - No physical device needed
  - Real-time dashboard of supervised user
  - Switch between different supervised user on-demand
  - Centralized monitoring from single device

### 4. Offline-First Architecture
- **Supervised user**: Data always saved locally first, then synced to cloud
- **Supervisors**: Automatic data download when reconnecting to internet
- No data loss during network interruptions
- Seamless operation in areas with poor connectivity
- Local SQLite database (Room) ensures data persistence
- Automatic background sync when network returns
- Battery-efficient offline operation

### 5. Intelligent Batch Processing
- Messages collected in 500-millisecond batches
- Reduces battery consumption and network usage
- Prevents database overload during high-frequency data streams
- Automatic queue management for incoming Bluetooth messages
- Thread-safe batch processing ensures data integrity
- Optimized for continuous 24/7 operation

### 6. Real-Time Data Mirroring (Supervisors)
- Firestore snapshot listeners provide instant updates
- Changes from supervised user appear immediately on supervisor's device
- Automatic mirror setup after login
- Mirrors re-attach automatically after network interruptions
- Smart deduplication prevents duplicate data entries
- Live UI updates without manual refresh

### 7. Cloud-Based Data Management
- Secure Google Firebase authentication with CredentialManager
- Centralized Firestore database with automatic backup
- Cross-device accessibility (access data from any device)
- Automatic document ID generation for unique message tracking
- Cloud-based user profile management
- Role and permissions stored securely in Firestore

### 8. Multi-User Supervision
- Single supervisor can monitor multiple supervised users, separately (one at a time)
- Individual data streams kept separate via owner mapping
- Filter and view specific user's data on demand
- Scalable for institutional use (nursing homes, hospitals, rehabilitation centers)
- Each supervised user's data tagged with unique owner ID
- Smart data purging when supervised user are removed
- Backfill system downloads historical data for new supervised user

### 9. Bluetooth Device Integration
- Automatic device scanning and discovery
- Reliable connection management with auto-retry (up to 2 retries)
- Foreground service ensures connection stays active
- Persistent notification shows connection status
- Real-time device status monitoring
- Graceful handling of connection interruptions
- Support for standard Bluetooth wearable devices

### 10. Smart Deduplication System
- Prevents duplicate messages in database
- Firestore listener can fire multiple times—system filters duplicates
- Unique constraint on device address + timestamp + message content
- Owner-aware deduplication (checks per supervised user)
- Reduces storage usage and improves query performance
- Ensures data accuracy and integrity

### 11. Network Resilience & Auto-Retry
- Automatic detection of network status changes
- Background retry mechanism for failed uploads
- Batch upload of missed messages when network returns
- No user intervention required for sync recovery
- Smart connectivity monitoring service
- Handles airplane mode, WiFi switching, and cellular transitions
- Exponential backoff prevents server overload (assumed)

### 12. Role-Based Navigation & UI
- Automatic routing based on user role (supervised vs supervisor)
- Supervised user directed to Bluetooth setup screen
- Supervisors bypass Bluetooth setup, go directly to monitoring dashboard
- Role selection saved and pre-filled on subsequent logins
- Session management handles role switching seamlessly
- Context-aware UI elements (hide/show based on role)

### 13. Historical Data Access
- Backfill system downloads past data on first login
- Query by timestamp to fetch only new messages
- Local Room database stores complete history
- Efficient incremental sync (only downloads what's missing)
- Fast local queries for historical analysis
- Data survives app reinstalls (cloud backup)

### 14. Owner Mapping System
- Critical for multi-user supervision
- Each message tagged with `owner_user_id` field
- Supervised user: owner = their own ID
- Supervisor mirrors: owner = supervised user's ID
- All queries filtered by owner to prevent data mixing
- Enables accurate per-user analytics and reporting

### 15. Google Sign-In Integration
- Secure authentication via Google CredentialManager
- One-tap sign-in experience
- No password management required
- Firebase Auth token caching for offline access
- User profile automatically created on first login
- Email autocomplete for finding supervised user
- Validated Gmail email format for supervisor assignments

### 16. Session Management & Bootstrapping
- SessionGate singleton orchestrates post-login workflow
- Loads user role and supervised user IDs from Firestore
- Automatic bootstrap: backfill + mirror setup based on role
- Session persistence across app restarts
- Thread-safe session state management
- Graceful handling of session load errors

### 17. Threading & Performance Optimization
- All network operations on background threads
- All database operations on background threads
- UI updates only on main thread (proper Android practices)
- No blocking operations that freeze the UI
- ExecutorService manages background task pool
- Dedicated Bluetooth thread for device communication
- Separate batch-saving thread for periodic database inserts

### 18. Comprehensive Error Handling
- Network errors: Graceful fallback to local storage
- Bluetooth errors: Automatic reconnection attempts
- Authentication errors: Clear error messages and prompts
- Validation errors: Inline feedback on forms
- Firestore errors: Logged with context for debugging
- Database errors: Transaction rollback and retry logic

### 19. Developer-Friendly Architecture
- Clean separation of concerns (UI, Business Logic, Data)
- Extensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Documented decision points and flow branches
- Assumption tracking for code clarity
- Thread annotations throughout codebase
- ViewModel pattern for UI state management
- Repository pattern for data access

### 20. Notifications & Alerts System
- Local fall notifications for supervised user
- Remote fall notifications for supervisors
- System notification tray integration
- Notification includes supervised user identification
- Tappable notifications open app to relevant screen
- Foreground service notification shows connection status
- Alert history preserved in Room database
