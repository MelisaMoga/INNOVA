## ðŸ“˜ Executive Summary

The InnovaMotion app supports two user types:
1. **Supervised users**: Connect a Bluetooth wearable device, receive posture data, and upload it to the cloud
2. **Supervisors**: Monitor data from one or more supervised users in real-time

After successful Google sign-in at `LoginActivity.java`, users select their role and the app:
- Loads their profile from Firebase (on a **background thread**)
- Backfills historical data from the cloud
- Routes them to `MainActivity.java`

For **supervised users**, incoming Bluetooth messages follow this pipeline:
1. Connection thread receives raw data â†’ adds to in-memory batch queue
2. Batch-saving thread (every **500 ms**) saves batch to local **Room database** â†’ attempts Firebase upload
3. Retry/offline handling ensures data reaches the cloud when connectivity returns

For **supervisors**, real-time monitoring works via Firestore mirrors:
1. After login, mirrors (snapshot listeners) attach to supervised users' data streams
2. New messages automatically download and insert into Room with owner mapping
3. Fall detection runs on incoming messages â†’ supervisor receives instant notifications
4. UI updates in real-time as supervised users' devices upload posture data
